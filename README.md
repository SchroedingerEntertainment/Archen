## Archen - A hybrid Tactical Card Game System

The Archen Card Game is a multiplayer collectible card game for a minimum of 2 players, in
which they take place in important events shaping the world their characters live in. Each
game consists of a series of objectives bringing those player’s main characters one step
further to achieving their goals for a greater good or dramatic disasters, or just their own
wellbeing.

The rules and mechanics provided are meant to work as a general rule set in which there is
room for additions. Some parts of them may be adapted, modified, or omitted based on the
format you choose to play, for as long as all players agree to the rules before the game
starts. This also includes cards and expansions allowed to be played

## Unique Card Tokens

The Archen Tactical Card Game System features QR codes printed on their cards. Those codes allow
their physical owner to also claim its digital ownership. This can be considered a Non-Fungible Token
or NFT. NFTs are a unique digital identifier that are recorded and used to certify ownership of a card. This
can also be transferred, allowing cards to be sold and traded not just offline but also online. This makes
the Archen Tactical Card Game System a hybrid solution, connecting offline and online activities in a
unique way.

The online activities offer not just the ability to build and play decks against NPC players and real life
competitors, they also offer different ways to manage a players competitive playing experience. What if a
player can register their deck online for a local store tournament or even play sancioned tournaments completely
online - gathering real life prices like special full-art prints of their favorite cards. So NFTs allow for
small quality of life improvements up to features that entirely rethink the way players collect their cards
and interact with the community.

Scanning a claimed card's QR code also allows to access their details like clarifying rules, erata and also
their current value in the market
